# **grocery\_smart**

Grocery_Smart was created to solve a common problem that second-year students face when moving into their first home. We never have anything to eat and all those vegetables we keep buying simply gets left in the fridge to go bad! Grocery_Smart is an IoT device that can turn any fridge into a smart fridge, the barcode of any product can be scanned by the device, our device will display useful information about all food that is stored inside the fridge. A monitor utilizes data visualization to intuitively display to the user, the stock of different food as well as how long before the food will spoil. The device can alert users through text or email before an item is about to go bad so that it may be eaten in time. This can reduce the number of waste products as well as save money spent on food.
